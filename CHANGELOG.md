# Changelog

All notable changes to the Jellyfin Playlist Modal Plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-22

### Added
- Initial release of Jellyfin Playlist Modal Plugin
- Playlist click interception with multiple detection methods (anchor tags, data attributes, hash URLs)
- Browser confirm modal for "Surprise Me" vs "Show List" options
- REST API endpoint: `GET /PlaylistModal/Random/{playlistId}?userId={userId}`
- Random unwatched item selection from playlists
- Navigation to item details page on "Surprise Me"
- Normal playlist navigation on "Show List"
- Graceful error handling for empty playlists and no unwatched items
- Multi-path fallback for JavaScript injection (Docker and native installations)
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- BaseItemDto serialization for proper API responses

### Technical Decisions
- JavaScript injection pattern for UI modification (non-invasive)
- Event capture phase for click interception (before other handlers)
- Browser confirm dialog for v1.0 (simple, reliable UX)
- Navigation to details page instead of autoplay (playbackManager scope limitation)
- Clean, production-ready code (no debug spam, no experimental attempts)

### Known Limitations
- No autoplay functionality (user must click play button on details page)
  - Reason: playbackManager is in bundled module scope, not globally accessible
  - May be addressed in future versions
- Uses native browser confirm() dialog instead of Jellyfin-styled modal
  - Will be improved in Phase 3
- Optimized for movie playlists only
  - TV show and music support planned for future releases

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- Jellyfin-styled modal dialog (Phase 3)
- Configuration page for admin settings
- TV show playlist support (random unwatched episode)
- Music playlist support (random unplayed track)
- Autoplay functionality (direct playback without details page navigation)
- Keyboard shortcuts (S for Surprise, L for List)
- Playlist statistics in modal (X unwatched of Y total)
- Remember user preference per playlist
- "Mark watched & next" quick action
- Multi-language support
